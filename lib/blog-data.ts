## Why Your Data Is on Broker Sites

Data brokers collect and sell your personal information from public records, social media, purchase history, and other sources. Sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, and BeenVerified aggregate this data and make it searchable by anyone.

## The Rise of Dating App Scams

Romance scams cost Americans over $1.3 billion in 2024 alone. With millions of people using apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge, scammers have a massive pool of potential victims.

## Red Flags to Watch For

### 1. Too Good to Be True Profiles
- Professional model-quality photos only
- Very short or generic bio
- Claims to be wealthy, military, or working abroad

### 2. Moves Too Fast
- Says "I love you" within days
- Wants to move off the app to WhatsApp or Telegram quickly
- Discusses a future together immediately

### 3. Avoids Video Calls
- Always has excuses for why they can't video chat
- Poor lighting or short clips only
- Never available when you suggest a call

### 4. Asks for Money
- Sob stories about emergencies or medical bills
- Investment "opportunities" (crypto is a huge red flag)
- Needs money for a plane ticket to meet you

### 5. Inconsistent Details
- Story changes over time
- Can't remember details they previously shared
- Photos don't match their described lifestyle

## How to Protect Yourself

1. **Reverse image search** their photos on Google
2. **Run a people search** on RevealAI to verify their identity
3. **Check their username** across platforms — scammers often reuse handles
4. **Never send money** to someone you haven't met in person
5. **Meet in public** places for the first several dates
6. **Trust your gut** — if something feels off, it probably is

## Use RevealAI to Verify

Before meeting someone from a dating app, run their name through RevealAI's search. You can check for criminal records, verify their identity, and even find their other social profiles. It takes 30 seconds and could save you from a dangerous situation.

## What Is Unclaimed Money?

Unclaimed money (also called unclaimed property) includes forgotten bank accounts, uncashed checks, insurance payouts, utility deposits, and more. When companies can't locate the owner, they're required to turn the money over to the state.

## How Much Is Out There?

The National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA) estimates there is over **$80 billion** in unclaimed property waiting to be claimed. The average claim is around $1,000, but some people have found tens of thousands.

## How to Search

### MissingMoney.com
Most states participate in MissingMoney.com, the official NAUPA database. This is the best starting point.

1. Visit [MissingMoney.com](https://www.missingmoney.com)
2. Enter your name
3. Search multiple states where you've lived
4. Follow the claim instructions if you find a match

### State-Specific Portals
Some states have their own portals:
- **California:** claimit.ca.gov
- **New York:** osc.state.ny.us
- **Texas:** claimittexas.org
- **Florida:** fltreasurehunt.gov

### Search Tips
- Search under **maiden names** and **previous addresses**
- Check for **deceased relatives** — you may be the rightful heir
- Search in **every state** you've ever lived in
- Try **variations** of your name

## Common Types of Unclaimed Money

- Bank accounts and CDs
- Forgotten utility deposits
- Insurance payouts and refunds
- Uncashed dividends or paychecks
- Safe deposit box contents
- Tax refunds

## Is It Really Free?

Yes! **Legitimate unclaimed property searches and claims are always free.** If someone asks you to pay to search or file a claim, it's likely a scam. RevealAI links you directly to official government databases.

## Start Searching

Use RevealAI's Unclaimed Money tool to quickly find your state's official search portal and start looking for money that might be owed to you.

## Why Use Reverse Phone Lookup?

We've all received calls from unknown numbers. Whether it's a potential spam caller, a missed call you're curious about, or a number texting you out of the blue, a reverse phone lookup helps you identify who's behind the number.

## What Information Can You Find?

A reverse phone lookup can reveal:
- **Owner's name** and address
- **Phone type** (mobile, landline, or VoIP)
- **Carrier** information
- **Location** data
- **Spam/scam reports** from other users
- **Associated social profiles**

## How to Use RevealAI's Phone Lookup

1. Navigate to the Phone Lookup page
2. Enter the phone number (with or without dashes)
3. Click "Lookup"
4. Review the comprehensive results

## Common Phone Scams to Watch For

### Robocalls
Automated messages about fake warranties, IRS threats, or prize winnings. Hang up immediately.

### Spoofed Numbers
Scammers can make their number appear as a local number or even a government agency. Don't trust caller ID alone.

### One-Ring Scams
A call that rings once and hangs up, hoping you'll call back a premium-rate number. Never call back unknown numbers.

### Smishing (SMS Phishing)
Text messages with links to fake websites designed to steal your information. Don't click links from unknown senders.

## Protecting Yourself

1. **Don't answer** calls from unknown numbers
2. **Use RevealAI** to check numbers before calling back
3. **Register** on the National Do Not Call Registry
4. **Block** spam numbers on your phone
5. **Report** scam numbers to the FTC

## Your Privacy Is Under Threat

Every day, companies collect vast amounts of your personal data. From browsing habits to location data, your digital footprint reveals more than you think. Here are 10 actionable steps to take back control.

## 1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords
Use a different password for every account. Make them at least 12 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Use RevealAI's Password Strength Checker to test yours.

## 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Turn on 2FA for every account that supports it. Use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy) instead of SMS when possible.

## 3. Remove Yourself from Data Brokers
Sites like Spokeo, WhitePages, and BeenVerified sell your personal information. Use RevealAI's Privacy Tools to find and remove your data from these sites.

## 4. Review App Permissions
Go through your phone's app permissions. Remove access to camera, microphone, contacts, and location for apps that don't need them.

## 5. Use a VPN on Public Wi-Fi
Public Wi-Fi networks are easy targets for hackers. A VPN encrypts your connection and protects your data.

## 6. Limit Social Media Sharing
Review your privacy settings on all social platforms. Avoid sharing your location, workplace, daily routines, and vacation plans publicly.

## 7. Monitor Your Credit
Freeze your credit with all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). This prevents identity thieves from opening accounts in your name.

## 8. Use Encrypted Messaging
Switch to encrypted messaging apps like Signal for sensitive conversations. Regular SMS messages can be intercepted.

## 9. Regularly Google Yourself
Search your name, phone number, and email address regularly. You might be surprised what comes up. Use RevealAI to run a comprehensive check.

## 10. Keep Software Updated
Enable automatic updates on all devices. Security patches fix vulnerabilities that hackers exploit.

## Take Action Today

Start with the easiest steps — update your passwords and check your data broker exposure with RevealAI's free Privacy Score. Small changes compound into significant protection over time.
